# Phase 1: Consolidation Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-28

**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Catalogue all diverged code across 6 copies (5 project dirs + `diagnosticos/complete_deployment/`) and produce a merge decision document. Nothing is written to `core/` yet — this phase only decides what will go there and how conflicts are resolved. Deliverable is a markdown document, not code.

## Implementation Decisions

### Core boundary — what belongs in core/ vs per-report module

Default rule: methods that exist in only ONE project and are specific to that report type's domain stay in the report module, NOT in `core/`.

**Override — user/form infrastructure goes to `core/` regardless of current distribution:**
- `download_users` → `core/` (even though currently only in ensayos_generales — user downloading is shared pipeline infrastructure)
- `download_and_process_form` → `core/` (even though currently only in assessment-analysis family — form processing is shared infrastructure)
- `save_form_responses_to_csv` → `core/` (same rationale — CSV output for form responses is shared)
- `_download_form_responses_full` → `core/` (already in 2+ projects, also infrastructure)

Per-report domain methods that stay per-report (report-type-specific logic, NOT infrastructure):
- `_normalize_commune`, `_compare_emails`, `_process_email_columns` (assessment-analysis-specific data normalization) → stay in `reports/assessment_analysis/`

Methods that exist in 2+ projects go into `core/` — these are the shared infrastructure.

### The ensayos_generales analyzer is architecturally separate

`ensayos_generales/assessment_analyzer.py` is completely different from the config-based family (`get_unique_identifiers`, `load_conversion_data`, `calculate_assessment_score`, `convert_score`). It should NOT be forced into the same `BaseReportGenerator`/`AssessmentAnalyzer` ABC. It lives as `reports/ensayos_generales/analyzer.py` — a report-specific helper, not a `core/` service.

The `BaseReportGenerator` ABC only governs the `generate()` interface — not the analysis approach.

### Claude's Discretion

- How to resolve `cleanup_incremental_files` vs `cleanup_temp_files` naming conflict — pick whichever name is clearest for the canonical core version
- Audit document format — method-by-method comparison table with explicit resolution decision per row
- Where `_download_form_responses_full` goes: DECIDED → `core/` (user/form infrastructure rule applies; body similarity check is still needed to reconcile the two versions, but destination is `core/`)
- Whether `diagnosticos_uim/complete_deployment` and `diagnosticos/complete_deployment` share enough differences to be audited separately or can be treated as one
- How to handle the `main.py` vs `main_app.py` ambiguity in `diagnosticos_uim/complete_deployment/` — investigate which one Cloud Run actually calls

## Existing Code Insights

### Three families of assessment_downloader.py

| Family | Projects | Key additions vs others |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| Diagnosticos | diagnosticos/, diagnosticos_uim/, diagnosticos/complete_deployment/ | `cleanup_incremental_files`, `get_only_new_responses`, `get_incremental_json_file_path`, incremental merge flow |
| Ensayos | ensayos_generales/ | Superset of diagnosticos family + `get_temp_csv_file_path`, `get_temp_analysis_file_path`, `get_latest_user_timestamp_from_json`, `_download_form_responses_full` (**→ core/**), `save_temp_responses_to_csv`, `cleanup_temp_files`, `save_responses_to_csv(include_usernames)`, `download_users` (**→ core/**) |
| Assessment-analysis | assessment-analysis-project/, reportes de test de diagnostico/ | Different branch: no incremental JSON, adds `get_users_csv_file_path`, `download_form_responses_incremental`, `save_form_responses_to_csv` (**→ core/**), `_normalize_commune`, `_compare_emails`, `_process_email_columns`, `download_and_process_form` (**→ core/**) |

### Two families of assessment_analyzer.py

| Family | Projects | Structure |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Config-based | diagnosticos/, diagnosticos_uim/, assessment-analysis-project/, reportes de test de diagnostico/ | Config-driven, category/percentage analysis, `analyze_assessment()` + `analyze_assessment_from_csv()`. Note: diagnosticos has `_analyze_by_category_generic` that diagnosticos_uim doesn't |
| Score-conversion | ensayos_generales/ | Completely different: conversion tables, `calculate_assessment_score`, `convert_score`, `analyze_all_assessments` |

### Env variable naming inconsistency

- `diagnosticos`/`diagnosticos_uim` use `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` + assessment-specific IDs
- `shared/env.template` uses `GCP_PROJECT_ID` (different name for same thing)
- `shared/env.template` includes Slack config, SMTP_SERVER, GCP_BUCKET_NAME not present in others

### Integration Points

- `diagnosticos_uim/complete_deployment/` has both `main.py` AND `main_app.py` — entry point is ambiguous
- `diagnosticos/complete_deployment/` only has `main.py` — no ambiguity
- `shared/` already has canonical versions of `drive_service.py`, `email_sender.py`, `storage.py` — these don't need diff audit, just promotion to `core/`
