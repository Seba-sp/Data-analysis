# Roadmap: Unified Report Pipeline

## Overview

Six independently-evolved copies of the same pipeline codebase are consolidated into a single Python framework. The work proceeds in strict dependency order: audit all diverged files before writing any shared code, build a stable `core/` package, validate the plugin interface with one report type, build the entry points, deploy to GCP, migrate the remaining four report types, and prove the new docxtpl path. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability. The result is a codebase where adding a new report type means creating one module and one template — nothing else.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Consolidation Audit** - Diff all 6 diverged file copies and produce a merge decision document before writing any shared code
- [x] **Phase 2: Core Package** - Build `core/` with canonical single versions of all shared services, per-report data namespacing, and the plugin base class (completed 2026-03-01)
- [x] **Phase 3: First Plugin Migration** - Port `diagnosticos` into the plugin structure and verify it produces identical output to the standalone version (completed 2026-03-01)
- [x] **Phase 4: Unified Entry Points** - Build the local CLI (`main.py`), `PipelineRunner`, dry-run mode, test-email mode, and structured result schema (completed 2026-03-01)
- [x] **Phase 5: GCP Deployment** - Build the unified webhook service, single `Dockerfile`, health endpoint, and decommission `complete_deployment/` (completed 2026-03-01)
- [ ] **Phase 6: Remaining Migrations** - Migrate the four remaining report types and complete the plugin registry

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Consolidation Audit
**Goal**: Developer has a documented merge decision for every diverged method before any canonical code is written
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CORE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A merge decision document exists listing every method that differs across all 6 copies of `assessment_downloader.py` and `assessment_analyzer.py`, with an explicit resolution for each
  2. The `complete_deployment/` subfolders are treated as independent audited copies (not footnotes), and their version differences from parent directories are documented
  3. A unified `requirements.txt` candidate exists with all version conflicts resolved (pandas, weasyprint, protobuf) and the resolution rationale documented
  4. All environment variables across all 5 projects are catalogued in a `.env.example` consolidation document
  5. The actual Cloud Run entry point for `diagnosticos_uim` (`main.py` vs `main_app.py`) is identified and documented
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Run body diffs on diverged methods and write MERGE-DECISIONS.md with all method resolutions, requirements.txt candidate, and env var catalogue

### Phase 2: Core Package
**Goal**: A stable `core/` package exists as the single source of truth for all shared pipeline services, with per-report data namespacing and a plugin base class ready for the first generator
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04, CORE-05, PLUG-01, PLUG-03, ORG-01, ORG-02, ORG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `from core.assessment_downloader import AssessmentDownloader` works and the module contains exactly one reconciled version of every method (no duplicates from different project copies)
  2. `from core.assessment_analyzer import AssessmentAnalyzer` works with identical reconciliation
  3. `from core.storage import StorageClient`, `from core.email_sender import EmailSender`, and `from core.drive_service import DriveService` all work from the canonical `core/` package
  4. No file in the unified codebase uses a bare flat import (`from storage import ...`) — all imports use `from core.X import Y`
  5. `reports/base.py` contains `BaseReportGenerator` ABC with the `generate()` interface; `reports/__init__.py` contains an empty `REGISTRY` dict; `data/<report_type>/raw/`, `data/<report_type>/processed/`, and `data/<report_type>/analysis/` directory conventions are established and documented; all templates live under `templates/<report_type>/`
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold core/__init__.py, reports/__init__.py, reports/base.py (BaseReportGenerator ABC), empty REGISTRY, requirements.txt, .env.example
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Assemble core/assessment_downloader.py by merging all 6 copies per MERGE-DECISIONS.md
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Assemble core/assessment_analyzer.py (diagnosticos as canonical base for all methods)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Promote storage.py, email_sender.py, drive_service.py, slack_service.py, upload_folder_to_gcs.py to core/; delete shared/
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Migrate all bare flat imports to package imports across all project subdirectories

### Phase 3: First Plugin Migration
**Goal**: The `diagnosticos` report type runs via the unified framework and produces output identical to its current standalone version, proving the plugin interface end-to-end
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: MIG-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `reports/diagnosticos/generator.py` exists, extends `BaseReportGenerator`, and is registered in `REGISTRY` under the key `"diagnosticos"`
  2. Running the pipeline for report type `diagnosticos` with the same input data produces a report file byte-for-byte (or content-equivalent) to the output of the pre-migration standalone version
  3. The `diagnosticos` generator's assessment type list (`["M1", "CL", "CIEN", "HYST"]`) lives in `generator.py` only — it does not appear anywhere in `core/`
  4. All `diagnosticos`-specific templates and question data files are organized under `templates/diagnosticos/` and `data/diagnosticos/questions/` respectively
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold reports/diagnosticos/ package and move templates + question CSVs to canonical per-report-type locations
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Implement DiagnosticosGenerator, register in REGISTRY, verify output equivalence against standalone version

### Phase 4: Unified Entry Points
**Goal**: A single `main.py` routes to any registered report type, runs the full pipeline through `PipelineRunner`, and supports dry-run and test-email modes with a structured result on every exit
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: ENTRY-01, ENTRY-03, ENTRY-04, DX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `python main.py --report-type diagnosticos` runs the full pipeline end-to-end using only `core/` services and the registered generator — no legacy standalone `main.py` is invoked
  2. `python main.py --report-type diagnosticos --dry-run` completes download, analysis, and generation steps without sending any email or uploading anything to Drive
  3. `python main.py --report-type diagnosticos --test-email developer@example.com` redirects all outgoing email to the specified address instead of student addresses
  4. Every pipeline exit (success or failure, local or GCP) returns a dict matching `{success: bool, records_processed: int, emails_sent: int, errors: list}` — no pipeline path returns `None` or an unstructured value
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Implement PipelineRunner in core/runner.py with email loop, Drive upload, dry-run/test-email controls, and structured PipelineResult
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Create main.py CLI entry point wiring --report-type, --dry-run, --test-email to PipelineRunner

### Phase 5: GCP Deployment
**Goal**: A single Dockerfile deploys all report types to Cloud Run; the webhook service routes events to the correct generator; health endpoint is available; `complete_deployment/` subfolders are removed
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: ENTRY-02, GCP-01, GCP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docker build -t unified-pipeline . && docker run -e REPORT_TYPE=diagnosticos unified-pipeline` succeeds locally with the unified `core/` package structure — no ImportError at startup or on first request
  2. A LearnWorlds webhook event for a `diagnosticos` assessment ID is received, validated (HMAC), queued in Firestore, and processed by the `diagnosticos` generator — verified via a test webhook delivery
  3. `GET /status` returns a JSON response with queue state and last-run metadata for every Cloud Run-deployed report type configuration
  4. The `complete_deployment/` subfolder inside `diagnosticos/` and `diagnosticos_uim/` no longer exists — all Cloud Run deployments use the unified Dockerfile
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Promote FirestoreService, TaskService, BatchProcessor, AssessmentMapper to core/
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Write unified webhook_service.py at repo root with all route handlers
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Write Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh for two-mode Cloud Run container
- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md — Deploy to Cloud Run, verify test webhook delivery, decommission complete_deployment/

### Phase 6: Remaining Migrations
**Goal**: All four remaining report types run via the unified framework with verified identical output, the plugin registry maps all four keys, and each plugin is reachable via main.py and the webhook service
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: MIG-02, MIG-03, MIG-04, MIG-05, PLUG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `reports/diagnosticos_uim/generator.py`, `reports/ensayos_generales/generator.py`, and `reports/test_diagnostico/generator.py` all exist, extend `BaseReportGenerator`, and are registered in `REGISTRY`
  2. Running each of the three migrated report types with their respective input data produces output content-equivalent to the current standalone versions
  3. The REGISTRY in `reports/__init__.py` maps all 4 report type keys: `diagnosticos`, `diagnosticos_uim`, `ensayos_generales`, `test_diagnostico`
  4. `get_generator("diagnosticos_uim")` (and equivalents) returns the correct class without error
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01-PLAN.md — Create DiagnosticosUIMGenerator plugin: copy and update report_generator.py, copy templates + question banks, create generator.py
- [ ] 06-02-PLAN.md — Create EnsayosGeneralesGenerator plugin: copy and update report_generator.py, copy templates, create generator.py with manual-prep CSV pattern
- [ ] 06-03-PLAN.md — Create TestDiagnosticoGenerator plugin: copy 5 support modules with updated imports, copy templates, create generator.py with manual-prep Excel pattern
- [ ] 06-04-PLAN.md — Wire all three generators into REGISTRY in reports/__init__.py; human visual spot-check on all plugins
