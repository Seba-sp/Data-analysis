Before answering i'll provide some context, learnworlds has autommations when submitting an assessment to send a webhook with a payload, i will use this for when a new users decides to buy a category, he gets assigned a diagnosis course, he completes the diagnosis assessment and gets assigned to a level course and the base course with the lectures, for most users this will happen in a single week with all of them taking the diagnosis assessment in that week, around 2000 per category and my program has 4 categories, and the rest of the year i'll get maybe 50 in a week, with the webhook, i want to implement sending the user an email with a pdf telling him his level and the lectures he failed so he has to complete in the base course right after he submitted the diagnosis assessment. 
Critical Questions Before Implementation
1. Webhook Authentication & Security
How does LearnWorlds authenticate webhook requests?
Do they send a secret token?
Do they use API keys in headers?
Do they sign the payload?
R: i got this from their documentation.
Webhook signatures
Format
With each incoming webhook from Learnworlds, a pre-shared Learnworlds-Webhook-Signature header is included, as shown in the following example: Learnworlds-Webhook-Signature: v1=e8fad5b079d0977f61bc2d21fc5f461719e6478df7de56
You can find the webhook signature in Learnworlds platform under Settings>Developers>Webhooks.
Compare the Learnworlds-Webhook-Signature, prefixed by v1=, to the expected signature. If they match, then you can trust that the event payload was issued by LearnWorlds.
Mitigate MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks
To prevent MITM attacks resulting the signature being compromised use HTTPS for all your webhook endpoints.

What security measures do you need?
IP whitelisting?
Request validation?
Rate limiting?
I don't know, i'm also new to this.
2. Webhook Payload Structure
What exactly does the webhook payload contain?
this is an example of the payload. to send this example payload. {
    "user": {
        "id": "{{user.id}}",
        "username": "{{user.username}}",
        "email": "{{user.email}}"
    },
    "assessment": {
        "title": "{{assessment.title}}",
        "url": "{{assessment.url}}"
    },
    "submission": {
        "id": "{{submission.id}}",
        "status": "{{submission.status}}",
        "grading_status": "{{submission.grading_status}}",
        "answers": "{{submission.answers}}",
        "score": "{{submission.score}}"
    },
    "school": {
        "name": "{{school.name}}",
        "url": "{{school.url}}",
        "description": "{{school.description}}",
        "address": "{{school.address}}",
        "company_name": "{{school.company_name}}",
        "contact_email": "{{school.contact_email}}",
        "support_email": "{{school.support_email}}",
        "sales_email": "{{school.sales_email}}"
    }
}
Are there different webhook types? only submission
3. Question Bank Management
How do you currently manage question banks? they are manually created and stored on the folder
Are they uploaded manually to bancos_preguntas/?
Do they follow a specific naming convention? assessment name
Are they course-specific or assessment-specific? the name will be category specific but will probably repeat between categories
How will this work with your storage abstraction? idk yet
Should question banks be stored in GCS when using GCP backend? yes
How do you want to handle question bank updates? idk yet
4. Email Configuration
What email service do you want to use? idk yet, i used the simplest to make the minimun viable version
Gmail SMTP (current in Test-diagnostico-pdf)?
GCP SendGrid?
Other SMTP provider?
Email templates:
Do you want to customize email content? no, only customize the pdf per student based on their answers
Should emails include course-specific information?
Do you need different email templates for different assessment types?
5. Report Storage & Management
Where should individual webhook reports be stored? on google drive or locally on a separate folderSeparate data/webhook_reports/ 
Report retention: idk yet
How long should individual reports be kept?
Should they be archived or deleted after a certain time?
6. Error Handling & Monitoring idk yet my biggest fear is when a lot of students completes an assessment at the same time, the program should be able to handle them all or have a checking system for users who completed the assessment but did not get their email
What happens if webhook processing fails?
Retry mechanism?
Dead letter queue?
Manual reprocessing?
Monitoring needs:
Do you want Slack notifications for webhook failures?
Logging requirements?
Metrics collection?
7. Course/Assessment Mapping
How do webhook assessments map to your course structure? they could, maybe some diagnosis course are not present in cursos.yml, most of the time they will
Do webhook assessments correspond to courses in cursos.yml?
How do you identify which course an assessment belongs to? idk yet
Are there assessments that don't fit your current course structure? No
8. Deployment Strategy
Do you want to deploy webhook service immediately? i want to test locally, deploy and test again
Or test locally first?
Should it be deployed to the same GCP project? idk yet
Do you need different environments (dev/staging/prod)?
9. Integration with Existing Workflow
How should webhook processing integrate with batch processing?idk what's best
Should webhook data be included in batch reports? no
Should there be deduplication between webhook and batch processing?i don't know what this means
Do you want to track which reports came from webhooks vs batch?no, they should be in separate folders
10. Configuration Management idk any questions on this section
How should webhook-specific settings be configured? 
Add to existing .env template?
Separate webhook configuration file?
Environment variables in Cloud Run?
Questions That Could Wait
These can be addressed during implementation:
Specific email template customization
Advanced monitoring setup
Report archiving policies
Performance optimization
Questions That Are Critical Now
These affect the initial architecture:
Webhook authentication method
Payload structure
Question bank storage strategy
Basic email configuration
Report storage location
Which of these questions can you answer now? The webhook authentication and payload structure are probably the most critical to get right before we start coding, as they'll affect the core webhook endpoint design.
Also, do you have access to the LearnWorlds webhook documentation or can you share an example of what the webhook payload looks like?
